## V1
 Version 1 is a computer-interfaced data acquisition board for pressure and flow, which can be connected via VCP over USB. It can also control an on-board motor controller for an up to 2.4 A, 12 VDC motor via PWM.
 
## V2
 Version 2 is a standalone device that allows measurement and control of pressure and flow via two potentiometers, has a 16x2 LCD display for reading off numbers on the fly, and has an alarm buzzer. It also has an on-board motor controller like in V1, and can still be interfaced with a computer via USB.
